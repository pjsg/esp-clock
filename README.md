# **Pulse Clock Controller** #

This project includes the hardware and software for a clock control module. This can drive pulse driven clocks -- often at 24 Volts with either 1 or 2 pulses per second
with either unipolar drive or bipolar drive. The control board is based around an ESP8266 module which gets the time and generates the pulse train.

The code is in a pretty shaky state and needs a lot of cleanup.
